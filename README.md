# Kalman-Filter-and-Proportional-Navigation-Based-Missile-Guidance-System
This paper presents a missile guidance system combining Kalman Filter and Proportional Navigation (PN). A fully adaptive Kalman filter estimates key signals for PN guidance, optimizing target tracking. The study compares PN with other navigation algorithms for improved missile accuracy.
