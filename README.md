# Kalman Filter and Proportional Navigation Based Missile Guidance System

This repository summarizes the IEEE paper on integrating Kalman Filters with Proportional Navigation (PN) for advanced missile guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems.

## Abstract
Presents a missile guidance framework using a fully adaptive Kalman Filter to process real-time measurements, enhance guidance signals, and optimize PN algorithm performance for improved missile accuracy.

## Key Contributions
- Presents an adaptive Kalman filter for real-time missile state estimation.
- Integrates PN algorithm for target interception and trajectory optimization.
- Provides comparative analysis versus alternate navigation methods and filters.

## Technologies & Methods
- Kalman Filter (KF, EKF, UKF)
- Proportional Navigation (PN) Guidance
- Python (recommended implementation platform)

## How to Use
1. Model the missile-target dynamics as described.
2. Apply Kalman filtering for measurement updates.
3. Implement PN law for real-time guidance control.
4. Compare performance with pursuit and Q guidance.
